# DTLogExtSim

## üöÄ How To Run
1. **Install Docker:**  
    Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com).
2. **Clone or Download the Project**
3. **Run the Service:**  
    In the directory containing `docker-compose.yml`, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    This command ensures you‚Äôre running the latest version of your app by rebuilding the Docker images before launching the containers. It‚Äôs useful when you‚Äôve made changes to the source code or Dockerfile and want to see the updated behavior immediately.
4. **Access the UI:**
    Open your browser and navigate to:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extractor Parameters

| Argument           | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--simthreshold`   | 0.9      | Sets the similarity threshold for grouping resources and generating timetables. A higher value means stricter matching, grouping only very similar resources. |
| `--eta`            | 0.01     | Controls the sensitivity of the Split Miner algorithm to rare process behavior. Lower values allow detecting less frequent events or paths, while higher values focus on more common behaviors. |
| `--eps`            | 0.001    | Determines how strictly the Split Miner algorithm identifies parallel tasks. Smaller values can reveal more parallel activities; larger values tend to group them as sequential.                  |
